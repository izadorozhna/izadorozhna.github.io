System administration for Object Storage
========================================

By understanding Object Storage concepts, you can better monitor and
administer your storage solution. The majority of the administration
information is maintained in developer documentation at
`docs.openstack.org/developer/swift/ <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/swift/>`__.

See the `OpenStack Configuration
Reference <http://docs.openstack.org/kilo/config-reference/content/>`__
for a list of configuration options for Object Storage.
