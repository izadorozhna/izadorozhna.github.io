   * - Features
     - Benefits
   * - Leverages commodity hardware
     - No lock-in, lower price/GB.
   * - HDD/node failure agnostic
     - Self-healing, reliable, data redundancy protects from failures.
   * - Unlimited storage
     - Large and flat namespace, highly scalable read/write access,
       able to serve content directly from storage system.
   * - Multi-dimensional scalability
     - Scale-out architecture: Scale vertically and
       horizontally-distributed storage. Backs up and archives large
       amounts of data with linear performance.
   * - Account/container/object structure
     - No nesting, not a traditional file system: Optimized for scale,
       it scales to multiple petabytes and billions of objects.
   * - Built-in replication 3✕ + data redundancy (compared with 2✕ on
       RAID)
     - A configurable number of accounts, containers and object copies
       for high availability.
   * - Easily add capacity (unlike RAID resize)
     - Elastic data scaling with ease    .
   * - No central database
     - Higher performance, no bottlenecks.
   * - RAID not required
     - Handle many small, random reads and writes efficiently.
   * - Built-in management utilities
     - Account management: Create, add, verify, and delete users;
       Container management: Upload, download, and verify; Monitoring:
       Capacity, host, network, log trawling, and cluster health.
   * - Drive auditing
     - Detect drive failures preempting data corruption.
   * - Expiring objects
     - Users can set an expiration time or a TTL on an object to
       control access.
   * - Direct object access
     - Enable direct browser access to content, such as for a control
       panel.
   * - Realtime visibility into client requests
     - Know what users are requesting.
   * - Supports S3 API
     - Utilize tools that were designed for the popular S3 API.
   * - Restrict containers per account
     - Limit access to control usage by user.
   * - Support for NetApp, Nexenta, Solidfire
     - Unified support for block volumes using a variety of storage
       systems.
   * - Snapshot and backup API for block volumes.
     - Data protection and recovery for VM data.
   * - Standalone volume API available
     - Separate endpoint and API for integration with other compute
       systems.
   * - Integration with Compute
     -  Fully integrated with Compute for attaching block volumes and
        reporting on usage.
