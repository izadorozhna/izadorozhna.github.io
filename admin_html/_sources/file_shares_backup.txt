==================
Backup and restore
==================

Manila provides mechanism of snapshots to help users backup theirs own data.
Use :command:`manila snapshot-create` for it.

.. note::
    Share cann't be deleted while it has saved snapshots.

To restore your data from snapshot, use :command:`manila create` with key
`--snapshot-id`. It creates new share from exiting snapshot.

To export snapshot, you can create shares from it, then mount
new share to instance and then directly copy files from attached share into
archive.

To import snapshot, create new share with appropriate size, attach it to
instance and then copy file from archive to attached file system.
