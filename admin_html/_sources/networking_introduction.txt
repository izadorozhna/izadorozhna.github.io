Introduction to Networking
==========================

The Networking service, code-named neutron, provides an API that lets
you define network connectivity and addressing in the cloud. The
Networking service enables operators to leverage different networking
technologies to power their cloud networking. The Networking service
also provides an API to configure and manage a variety of network
services ranging from L3 forwarding and NAT to load balancing, edge
firewalls, and IPsec VPN.

For a detailed description of the Networking API abstractions and their
attributes, see the `OpenStack Networking API v2.0
Reference <http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref-networking-v2.html>`__.

Networking API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Networking is a virtual network service that provides a powerful API to
define the network connectivity and IP addressing that devices from
other services, such as Compute, use.

The Compute API has a virtual server abstraction to describe computing
resources. Similarly, the Networking API has virtual network, subnet,
and port abstractions to describe networking resources.

+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| Resource      | Description                                                 |
+===============+=============================================================+
| **Network**   | An isolated L2 segment, analogous to VLAN in the physical   |
|               | networking world.                                           |
+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Subnet**    | A block of v4 or v6 IP addresses and associated             |
|               | configuration state.                                        |
+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Port**      | A connection point for attaching a single device, such as   |
|               | the NIC of a virtual server, to a virtual network. Also     |
|               | describes the associated network configuration, such as     |
|               | the MAC and IP addresses to be used on that port.           |
+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+

**Networking resources**

To configure rich network topologies, you can create and configure
networks and subnets and instruct other OpenStack services like Compute
to attach virtual devices to ports on these networks.

In particular, Networking supports each tenant having multiple private
networks and enables tenants to choose their own IP addressing scheme,
even if those IP addresses overlap with those that other tenants use.

The Networking service:

-  Enables advanced cloud networking use cases, such as building
   multi-tiered web applications and enabling migration of applications
   to the cloud without changing IP addresses.

-  Offers flexibility for the cloud administrator to customize network
   offerings.

-  Enables developers to extend the Networking API. Over time, the
   extended functionality becomes part of the core Networking API.

Configure SSL support for networking API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OpenStack Networking supports SSL for the Networking API server. By
default, SSL is disabled but you can enable it in the :file:`neutron.conf`
file.

Set these options to configure SSL:

``use_ssl = True``
    Enables SSL on the networking API server.

``ssl_cert_file = PATH_TO_CERTFILE``
    Certificate file that is used when you securely start the Networking
    API server.

``ssl_key_file = PATH_TO_KEYFILE``
    Private key file that is used when you securely start the Networking
    API server.

``ssl_ca_file = PATH_TO_CAFILE``
    Optional. CA certificate file that is used when you securely start
    the Networking API server. This file verifies connecting clients.
    Set this option when API clients must authenticate to the API server
    by using SSL certificates that are signed by a trusted CA.

``tcp_keepidle = 600``
    The value of TCP\_KEEPIDLE, in seconds, for each server socket when
    starting the API server. Not supported on OS X.

``retry_until_window = 30``
    Number of seconds to keep retrying to listen.

``backlog = 4096``
    Number of backlog requests with which to configure the socket.

Load-Balancer-as-a-Service (LBaaS) overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Load-Balancer-as-a-Service (LBaaS) enables Networking to distribute
incoming requests evenly among designated instances. This distribution
ensures that the workload is shared predictably among instances and
enables more effective use of system resources. Use one of these load
balancing methods to distribute incoming requests:

Round robin
    Rotates requests evenly between multiple instances.

Source IP
    Requests from a unique source IP address are consistently directed
    to the same instance.

Least connections
    Allocates requests to the instance with the least number of active
    connections.

+-------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| Feature                 | Description                                       |
+=========================+===================================================+
| **Monitors**            | LBaaS provides availability monitoring with the   |
|                         | ``ping``, TCP, HTTP and HTTPS GET methods.        |
|                         | Monitors are implemented to determine whether     |
|                         | pool members are available to handle requests.    |
+-------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| **Management**          | LBaaS is managed using a variety of tool sets.    |
|                         | The REST API is available for programmatic        |
|                         | administration and scripting. Users perform       |
|                         | administrative management of load balancers       |
|                         | through either the CLI (``neutron``) or the       |
|                         | OpenStack dashboard.                              |
+-------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| **Connection limits**   | Ingress traffic can be shaped with *connection    |
|                         | limits*. This feature allows workload control,    |
|                         | and can also assist with mitigating DoS (Denial   |
|                         | of Service) attacks.                              |
+-------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| **Session persistence** | LBaaS supports session persistence by ensuring    |
|                         | incoming requests are routed to the same instance |
|                         | within a pool of multiple instances. LBaaS        |
|                         | supports routing decisions based on cookies and   |
|                         | source IP address.                                |
+-------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+


Firewall-as-a-Service (FWaaS) overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Firewall-as-a-Service (FWaaS) plug-in adds perimeter firewall
management to Networking. FWaaS uses iptables to apply firewall policy
to all Networking routers within a project. FWaaS supports one firewall
policy and logical firewall instance per project.

Whereas security groups operate at the instance-level, FWaaS operates at
the perimeter to filter traffic at the neutron router.

.. Note::

    FWaaS is currently in technical preview; untested operation is not
    recommended.

The example diagram illustrates the flow of ingress and egress traffic
for the VM2 instance:

|FWaaS architecture|

**To enable FWaaS**

FWaaS management options are also available in the OpenStack dashboard.

#. Enable the FWaaS plug-in in the :file:`/etc/neutron/neutron.conf` file:

   .. code-block:: ini
      :linenos:

       service_plugins = firewall
       [service_providers]
       ...
       service_provider = FIREWALL:Iptables:neutron.agent.linux.iptables_
       firewall.OVSHybridIptablesFirewallDriver:default

       [fwaas]
       driver = neutron_fwaas.services.firewall.drivers.linux.iptables_
       fwaas.IptablesFwaasDriver
       enabled = True

   .. Note::

       On Ubuntu, modify the ``[fwaas]`` section in the
       :file:`/etc/neutron/fwaas_driver.ini` file instead of
       :file:`/etc/neutron/neutron.conf`.

#. Create the required tables in the database:

   .. code:: console

       # neutron-db-manage --service fwaas upgrade head

#. Enable the option in the
   :file:`/usr/share/openstack-dashboard/openstack_dashboard/local/local_settings.py`
   file, which is typically located on the controller node:

   .. code:: ini

        OPENSTACK_NEUTRON_NETWORK = {
            ...
            'enable_firewall' = True,
            ...
        }

#. Restart the neutron-l3-agent and neutron-server services to apply the
   settings.

**To configure Firewall-as-a-Service**

Create the firewall rules and create a policy that contains them. Then,
create a firewall that applies the policy.

#. Create a firewall rule:

   .. code:: console

       $ neutron firewall-rule-create --protocol {tcp|udp|icmp|any}
       --destination-port PORT_RANGE --action {allow|deny}

   The Networking client requires a protocol value; if the rule is protocol
   agnostic, you can use the ``any`` value.

#. Create a firewall policy:

   .. code:: console

       $ neutron firewall-policy-create --firewall-rules
       "FIREWALL_RULE_IDS_OR_NAMES" myfirewallpolicy

   Separate firewall rule IDs or names with spaces. The order in which you
   specify the rules is important.

   You can create a firewall policy without any rules and add rules later,
   as follows:

   -  To add multiple rules, use the update operation.

   -  To add a single rule, use the insert-rule operation.

   For more details, see `Networking command-line
   client <http://docs.openstack.org/cli-reference/content/
   neutronclient_commands.html#neutronclient_subcommand_
   firewall-policy-create>`__
   in the OpenStack Command-Line Interface Reference.

   .. Note::

       FWaaS always adds a default ``deny all`` rule at the lowest precedence of
       each policy. Consequently, a firewall policy with no rules blocks
       all traffic by default.

#. Create a firewall:

   .. code:: console

       $ neutron firewall-create  FIREWALL_POLICY_UUID

   .. Note::

       The firewall remains in PENDING\_CREATE state until you create a
       Networking router and attach an interface to it.

**Allowed-address-pairs.**

``Allowed-address-pairs`` enable you to specify
mac_address/ip_address(cidr) pairs that pass through a port regardless
of subnet. This enables the use of protocols such as VRRP, which floats
an IP address between two instances to enable fast data plane failover.

.. Note::

   Currently, only the ML2, Open vSwitch, and VMware NSX plug-ins
   support the allowed-address-pairs extension.

**Basic allowed-address-pairs operations.**

- Create a port with a specified allowed address pairs:

  .. code:: console

     $ neutron port-create net1 --allowed-address-pairs type=dict
       list=true mac_address=MAC_ADDRESS,ip_address=IP_CIDR

- Update a port by adding allowed address pairs:

  .. code:: console

     $ neutron port-update PORT_UUID --allowed-address-pairs type=dict
     list=true mac_address=MAC_ADDRESS,ip_address=IP_CIDR

.. Note::

    In releases earlier than Juno, OpenStack Networking prevents setting
    an allowed address pair on a port that matches the MAC address and
    one of the fixed IP addresses of the port.

Virtual-Private-Network-as-a-Service (VPNaaS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The VPNaaS extension enables OpenStack tenants to extend private networks
across the internet.

This extension introduces these resources:

- :term:`service`. A parent object that associates VPN with a specific subnet
  and router.

- The Internet Key Exchange (IKE) policy that identifies the authentication
  and encryption algorithm to use during phase one and two negotiation of a
  VPN connection.

- The IP security policy that specifies the authentication and encryption
  algorithm and encapsulation mode to use for
  the established VPN connection.

- Details for the site-to-site IPsec connection, including the peer CIDRs,
  MTU, authentication mode, peer address, DPD settings, and status.

This initial implementation of the VPNaaS extension provides:

- Site-to-site VPN that connects two private networks.

- Multiple VPN connections per tenant.

- IKEv1 policy support with 3des, aes-128, aes-256, or aes-192 encryption.

- IPSec policy support with 3des, aes-128, aes-192, or aes-256 encryption,
  sha1 authentication, ESP, AH, or AH-ESP transform protocol, and tunnel or
  transport mode encapsulation.

- Dead Peer Detection (DPD) with hold, clear, restart, disabled, or
  restart-by-peer actions.
