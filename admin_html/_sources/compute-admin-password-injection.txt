.. _admin-password-injection:

====================================
Injecting the administrator password
====================================

Compute can generate a random administrator (root) password and inject
that password into an instance. If this feature is enabled, users can
run :command:`ssh` to an instance without an :command:`ssh` keypair.
The random password appears in the output of the :command:`nova boot` command.
You can also view and set the admin password from the dashboard.

**Password injection using the dashboard**

By default, the dashboard will display the ``admin`` password and allow
the user to modify it.

If you do not want to support password injection, disable the password
fields by editing the dashboard's :file:`local_settings` file. On
Fedora/RHEL/CentOS, the file location is
:file:`/etc/openstack-dashboard/local_settings`. On Ubuntu and Debian, it is
:file:`/etc/openstack-dashboard/local_settings.py`. On openSUSE and SUSE
Linux Enterprise Server, it is
:file:`/srv/www/openstack-dashboard/openstack_dashboard/local/local_settings.py`

.. code:: ini

    OPENSTACK_HYPERVISOR_FEATURES = {
    ...
        'can_set_password': False,
    }

**Password injection on libvirt-based hypervisors**

For hypervisors that use the libvirt back end (such as KVM, QEMU, and
LXC), admin password injection is disabled by default. To enable it, set
this option in :file:`/etc/nova/nova.conf`:

.. code:: ini

    [libvirt]
    inject_password=true

When enabled, Compute will modify the password of the admin account by
editing the :file:`/etc/shadow` file inside the virtual machine instance.

..  note::

    Users can only use :command:`ssh` to access the instance by using the admin
    password if the virtual machine image is a Linux distribution, and it has
    been configured to allow users to use :command:`ssh` as the root user. This
    is not the case for `Ubuntu cloud images`_ which, by default, does not
    allow users to use :command:`ssh` to access the root account.

**Password injection and XenAPI (XenServer/XCP)**

When using the XenAPI hypervisor back end, Compute uses the XenAPI agent
to inject passwords into guests. The virtual machine image must be
configured with the agent for password injection to work.

**Password injection and Windows images (all hypervisors)**

.. _Ubuntu cloud images: #

For Windows virtual machines, configure the Windows image to retrieve
the admin password on boot by installing an agent such as
`cloudbase-init`_.
