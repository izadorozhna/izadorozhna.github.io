Configure Identity service for Networking
=========================================

**To configure the Identity service for use with Networking**

#. Create the ``get_id()`` function

   The ``get_id()`` function stores the ID of created objects, and removes
   the need to copy and paste object IDs in later steps:

   a. Add the following function to your :file:`.bashrc` file:

      .. code:: ini

         function get_id () {
         echo `"$@" | awk '/ id / { print $4 }'`
         }

   b. Source the :file:`.bashrc` file:

      .. code:: console

         $ source .bashrc

#. Create the Networking service entry

   Networking must be available in the Compute service catalog. Create the
   service:

   .. code:: console

      $ NEUTRON_SERVICE_ID=$(get_id keystone service-create --name
      neutron --type network --description 'OpenStack Networking Service')

#. Create the Networking service endpoint entry

   The way that you create a Networking endpoint entry depends on whether
   you are using the SQL or the template catalog driver:

   -  If you use the *SQL driver*, run the following command with the
      specified region (``$REGION``), IP address of the Networking server
      (``$IP``), and service ID (``$NEUTRON_SERVICE_ID``, obtained in the
      previous step).

      .. code:: console

         $ keystone endpoint-create --region $REGION --service-id
           $NEUTRON_SERVICE_ID \
          --publicurl 'http://$IP:9696/' --adminurl 'http://$IP:9696/'
          --internalurl 'http://$IP:9696/'

      For example:

      .. code:: console

         $ keystone endpoint-create --region myregion --service-id
           $NEUTRON_SERVICE_ID \
          --publicurl "http://10.211.55.17:9696/" --adminurl
          "http://10.211.55.17:9696/" --internalurl
          "http://10.211.55.17:9696/"

   -  If you are using the *template driver*, specify the following
      parameters in your Compute catalog template file
      (:file:`default_catalog.templates`), along with the region (``$REGION``)
      and IP address of the Networking server (``$IP``).

      .. code:: bash

         catalog.$REGION.network.publicURL = http://$IP:9696
         catalog.$REGION.network.adminURL = http://$IP:9696
         catalog.$REGION.network.internalURL = http://$IP:9696
         catalog.$REGION.network.name = Network Service

      For example:

      .. code:: bash

         catalog.$Region.network.publicURL = http://10.211.55.17:9696
         catalog.$Region.network.adminURL = http://10.211.55.17:9696
         catalog.$Region.network.internalURL = http://10.211.55.17:9696
         catalog.$Region.network.name = Network Service

#. Create the Networking service user

   You must provide admin user credentials that Compute and some internal
   Networking components can use to access the Networking API. Create a
   special ``service`` tenant and a ``neutron`` user within this tenant,
   and assign an ``admin`` role to this role.

   a. Create the ``admin`` role:

      .. code:: console

         $ ADMIN_ROLE=$(get_id keystone role-create --name admin)

   b. Create the ``neutron`` user:

      .. code:: console

         $ NEUTRON_USER=$(get_id keystone user-create --name neutron\
         --pass "$NEUTRON_PASSWORD" --email demo@example.com --tenant-id service)

   c. Create the ``service`` tenant:

      .. code:: console

         $ SERVICE_TENANT=$(get_id keystone tenant-create --name
         service --description "Services Tenant")

   d. Establish the relationship among the tenant, user, and role:

      .. code:: console

         $ keystone user-role-add --user_id $NEUTRON_USER
         --role_id $ADMIN_ROLE --tenant_id $SERVICE_TENANT

For information about how to create service entries and users, see the
OpenStack Installation Guide for your distribution
(`docs.openstack.org <http://docs.openstack.org>`__).

Compute
~~~~~~~

If you use Networking, do not run the Compute nova-network service (like
you do in traditional Compute deployments). Instead, Compute delegates
most network-related decisions to Networking. Compute proxies
tenant-facing API calls to manage security groups and floating IPs to
Networking APIs. However, operator-facing tools such as nova-manage, are
not proxied and should not be used.

.. warning::

   When you configure networking, you must use this guide. Do not rely
   on Compute networking documentation or past experience with Compute.
   If a :command:`nova` command or configuration option related to networking
   is not mentioned in this guide, the command is probably not
   supported for use with Networking. In particular, you cannot use CLI
   tools like ``nova-manage`` and ``nova`` to manage networks or IP
   addressing, including both fixed and floating IPs, with Networking.

.. note::

   Uninstall nova-network and reboot any physical nodes that have been
   running nova-network before using them to run Networking.
   Inadvertently running the nova-network process while using
   Networking can cause problems, as can stale iptables rules pushed
   down by previously running nova-network.

To ensure that Compute works properly with Networking (rather than the
legacy nova-network mechanism), you must adjust settings in the
:file:`nova.conf` configuration file.

Networking API and credential configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each time you provision or de-provision a VM in Compute, nova-\*
services communicate with Networking using the standard API. For this to
happen, you must configure the following items in the :file:`nova.conf` file
(used by each nova-compute and nova-api instance).

.. list-table:: **nova.conf API and credential settings**
   :widths: 20 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Attribute name
     - Required
   * - ``[DEFAULT] network_api_class``
     - Modify from the default to ``nova.network.neutronv2.api.API``, to
       indicate that Networking should be used rather than the traditional
       nova-network networking model.
   * - ``[neutron] url``
     - Update to the hostname/IP and port of the neutron-server instance
       for this deployment.
   * - ``[neutron] auth_strategy``
     - Keep the default ``keystone`` value for all production deployments.
   * - ``[neutron] admin_tenant_name``
     - Update to the name of the service tenant created in the above section on
       Identity configuration.
   * - ``[neutron] admin_username``
     - Update to the name of the user created in the above section on Identity
       configuration.
   * - ``[neutron] admin_password``
     - Update to the password of the user created in the above section on
       Identity configuration.
   * - ``[neutron] admin_auth_url``
     - Update to the Identity server IP and port. This is the Identity
       (keystone) admin API server IP and port value, and not the Identity
       service API IP and port.

Configure security groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Networking service provides security group functionality using a
mechanism that is more flexible and powerful than the security group
capabilities built into Compute. Therefore, if you use Networking, you
should always disable built-in security groups and proxy all security
group calls to the Networking API. If you do not, security policies
will conflict by being simultaneously applied by both services.

To proxy security groups to Networking, use the following configuration
values in :file:`nova.conf`:

**nova.conf security group settings**

+-----------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| Item                  | Configuration                                       |
+=======================+=====================================================+
| ``firewall_driver``   | Update to ``nova.virt.firewall.NoopFirewallDriver``,|
|                       | so that nova-compute does not perform               |
|                       | iptables-based filtering itself.                    |
+-----------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| ``security_group_api``| Update to ``neutron``, so that all security group   |
|                       | requests are proxied to the Network Service.        |
+-----------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+

Configure metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Compute service allows VMs to query metadata associated with a VM by
making a web request to a special 169.254.169.254 address. Networking
supports proxying those requests to nova-api, even when the requests are
made from isolated networks, or from multiple networks that use
overlapping IP addresses.

To enable proxying the requests, you must update the following fields in
``[neutron]`` section in :file:`nova.conf`.

**nova.conf metadata settings**

+---------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Item                            | Configuration                            |
+=================================+==========================================+
| ``service_metadata_proxy``      | Update to ``true``, otherwise nova-api   |
|                                 | will not properly respond to requests    |
|                                 | from the neutron-metadata-agent.         |
+---------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
| ``metadata_proxy_shared_secret``| Update to a string "password" value.     |
|                                 | You must also configure the same value in|
|                                 | the ``metadata_agent.ini`` file, to      |
|                                 | authenticate requests made for metadata. |
|                                 |                                          |
|                                 | The default value of an empty string in  |
|                                 | both files will allow metadata to        |
|                                 | function, but will not be secure if any  |
|                                 | non-trusted entities have access to the  |
|                                 | metadata APIs exposed by nova-api.       |
+---------------------------------+------------------------------------------+

.. note::

   As a precaution, even when using ``metadata_proxy_shared_secret``,
   we recommend that you do not expose metadata using the same
   nova-api instances that are used for tenants. Instead, you should
   run a dedicated set of nova-api instances for metadata that are
   available only on your management network. Whether a given nova-api
   instance exposes metadata APIs is determined by the value of
   ``enabled_apis`` in its :file:`nova.conf`.
