Shared File Systems
===================

Shared File Systems service provides a set of services for management of
shared file systems in a multi-tenant cloud environment, similar to how
OpenStack provides for block-based storage management through the OpenStack
Block Storage service project. With the Shared File Systems service, you can
create a remote file system, mount the file system on your instances, and then
read and write data from your instances to and from your file system.

The Shared File Systems service serves same purpose as the Amazon Elastic File
System (EFS) does.
