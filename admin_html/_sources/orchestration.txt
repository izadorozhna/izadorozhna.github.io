=============

Orchestration is an orchestration engine that provides the
possibility to launch multiple composite cloud applications based on
templates in the form of text files that can be treated like code. A
native Heat Orchestration Template (HOT) format is evolving, but it
also endeavors to provide compatibility with the AWS CloudFormation
template format, so that many existing CloudFormation templates can
be launched on OpenStack.
