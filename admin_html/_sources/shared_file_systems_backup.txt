Manila provides mechanism of snapshots to help users backup theirs own data.
Use :command:`manila snapshot-create` for it.

.. note::
    You cannot delete share cannot while it has saved snapshots.

To restore your data from snapshot, use :command:`manila create` with key
`--snapshot-id`. This creates a new share from exiting snapshot.

To export snapshot, you can create shares from it, then mount new share to
instance and then directly copy files from attached share into archive.

To import snapshot, create new share with appropriate size, attach it to
instance and then copy file from archive to attached file system.
