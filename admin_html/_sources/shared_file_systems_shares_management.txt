Shares management
=================

The default configuration of the Shared File Systems service uses the OpenStack
Block Storage based back end. In that case, the Shared File Systems service
cares about everything (VMs, networking, keypairs, security groups) by itself.
It is not production solution, but can help you to understand how the Shared
File Systems service works.

.. note::

   The Shared File Systems service provides set of drivers that enable you to
   use various network file storage devices, instead of the base
   implementation. That is the real purpose of the Shared File Systems service
   service in production.

**To create file share using generic driver with default configuration**

#. Configure the Shared File Systems service through the :file:`manila.conf`
   file.
#. Use the :command:`manila share-network-create` to create share network.
   It points to the Shared File Systems service from what network new share
   will be used. This command creates service network and configure router to
   provide connectivity between it and share network.
#. Use the :command:`manila create` command to create a share. This
   command do the following things:

   * If there is no available share servers, the Shared File Systems service
     service will launch new instance from service image, attach it to service
     network and register it as a new share server.
   * Creates new volume of required size and attaches it to service instance.
   * The NFS service on service instance is configured to use attached volume
     and expose NFS share.
#. After share becomes available, use the nova :command:`manila show` command
   to get NFS share endpoint.
#. Use :command:`manila access-allow` command to grant access to the new share.
