Conventions
===========

The OpenStack documentation uses several typesetting conventions.

Notices
~~~~~~~

Notices take these forms:

.. note:: A handy tip or reminder.

.. important:: Something you must be aware of before proceeding.

.. warning:: Critical information about the risk of data loss or security
       issues.

Command prompts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: console

   $ command

Any user, including the ``root`` user, can run commands that are
prefixed with the ``$`` prompt.

.. code-block:: console

   # command

The ``root`` user must run commands that are prefixed with the ``#``
prompt. You can also prefix these commands with the :command:`sudo`
command, if available, to run them.
