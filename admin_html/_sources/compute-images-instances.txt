Images and instances
====================


Disk images provide templates for virtual machine file systems. The
Image service controls storage and management of images.

Instances are the individual virtual machines that run on physical
compute nodes. Users can launch any number of instances from the same
image. Each launched instance runs from a copy of the base image so that
any changes made to the instance do not affect the base image. You can
take snapshots of running instances to create an image based on the
current disk state of a particular instance. The Compute service manages
instances.

When you launch an instance, you must choose a ``flavor``, which
represents a set of virtual resources. Flavors define how many virtual
CPUs an instance has, the amount of RAM available to it, and the size of
its ephemeral disks. Users must select from the set of available flavors
defined on their cloud. OpenStack provides a number of predefined
flavors that you can edit or add to.

      in the OpenStack Operations Guide.

You can add and remove additional resources from running instances, such
as persistent volume storage, or public IP addresses. The example used
in this chapter is of a typical virtual system within an OpenStack
cloud. It uses the ``cinder-volume`` service, which provides persistent
block storage, instead of the ephemeral storage provided by the selected
instance flavor.

This diagram shows the system state prior to launching an instance. The
image store, fronted by the Image service (glance) has a number of
predefined images. Inside the cloud, a compute node contains the
available vCPU, memory, and local disk resources. Additionally, the
``cinder-volume`` service provides a number of predefined volumes.

|Base image state with no running instances|

To launch an instance select an image, flavor, and any optional
attributes. The selected flavor provides a root volume, labeled ``vda``
in this diagram, and additional ephemeral storage, labeled ``vdb``. In
this example, the ``cinder-volume`` store is mapped to the third virtual
disk on this instance, ``vdc``.

|Instance creation from image and runtime state|

The base image is copied from the image store to the local disk. The
local disk is the first disk that the instance accesses, labeled ``vda``
in this diagram. Your instances will start up faster if you use smaller
images, as less data needs to be copied across the network.

A new empty ephemeral disk is also created, labeled ``vdb`` in this
diagram. This disk is destroyed when you delete the instance.

The compute node connects to the attached ``cinder-volume`` using ISCSI. The
``cinder-volume`` is mapped to the third disk, labeled ``vdc`` in this
diagram. After the compute node provisions the vCPU and memory
resources, the instance boots up from root volume ``vda``. The instance
runs, and changes data on the disks (highlighted in red on the diagram).
If the volume store is located on a separate network, the
``my_block_storage_ip`` option specified in the storage node
configuration file directs image traffic to the compute node.

.. note::

   Some details in this example scenario might be different in your
   environment. For example, you might use a different type of back-end
   storage, or different network protocols. One common variant is that
   the ephemeral storage used for volumes ``vda`` and ``vdb`` could be
   backed by network storage rather than a local disk.

When the instance is deleted, the state is reclaimed with the exception
of the persistent volume. The ephemeral storage is purged; memory and
vCPU resources are released. The image remains unchanged throughout this
process.

Image management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The OpenStack Image service discovers, registers, and retrieves virtual
machine images. The service also includes a RESTful API that allows you
to query VM image metadata and retrieve the actual image with HTTP
requests. For more information about the API, see the `OpenStack API
Complete Reference <http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref.html>`__ and
the `Python
API <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/python-glanceclient/>`__.

The OpenStack Image service can be controlled using a command-line tool.
For more information about using the OpenStack Image command-line tool,
see the `Manage
Images <http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/common/cli_manage_images.html>`__
section in the OpenStack End User Guide.

Virtual images that have been made available through the Image service
can be stored in a variety of ways. In order to use these services, you
must have a working installation of the Image service, with a working
endpoint, and users that have been created in OpenStack Identity.
Additionally, you must meet the environment variables required by the
Compute and Image service clients.

The Image service supports these back-end stores:

File system
    The OpenStack Image service stores virtual machine images in the
    file system back end by default. This simple back end writes image
    files to the local file system.

Object Storage
    The OpenStack highly available service for storing objects.

Block Storage
    The OpenStack highly available service for storing blocks.

VMware
    ESX/ESXi or vCenter Server target system.

S3
    The Amazon S3 service.

HTTP
    OpenStack Image service can read virtual machine images that are
    available on the Internet using HTTP. This store is read only.

RADOS block device (RBD)
    Stores images inside of a Ceph storage cluster using Ceph's RBD
    interface.

Sheepdog
    A distributed storage system for QEMU/KVM.

GridFS
    Stores images using MongoDB.


Image properties and property protection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An image property is a key and value pair that the cloud administrator
or the image owner attaches to an OpenStack Image service image, as
follows:

-  The cloud administrator defines core properties, such as the image
   name.

-  The cloud administrator and the image owner can define additional
   properties, such as licensing and billing information.

The cloud administrator can configure any property as protected, which
limits which policies or user roles can perform CRUD operations on that
property. Protected properties are generally additional properties to
which only cloud administrators have access.

For unprotected image properties, the cloud administrator can manage
core properties and the image owner can manage additional properties.


**To configure property protection**

To configure property protection, the cloud administrator completes
these steps:

#. Define roles or policies in the :file:`policy.json` file::

    {
        "context_is_admin":  "role:admin",
        "default": "",

        "add_image": "",
        "delete_image": "",
        "get_image": "",
        "get_images": "",
        "modify_image": "",
        "publicize_image": "role:admin",
        "copy_from": "",

        "download_image": "",
        "upload_image": "",

        "delete_image_location": "",
        "get_image_location": "",
        "set_image_location": "",

        "add_member": "",
        "delete_member": "",
        "get_member": "",
        "get_members": "",
        "modify_member": "",

        "manage_image_cache": "role:admin",

        "get_task": "",
        "get_tasks": "",
        "add_task": "",
        "modify_task": "",

        "deactivate": "",
        "reactivate": "",

        "get_metadef_namespace": "",
        "get_metadef_namespaces":"",
        "modify_metadef_namespace":"",
        "add_metadef_namespace":"",

        "get_metadef_object":"",
        "get_metadef_objects":"",
        "modify_metadef_object":"",
        "add_metadef_object":"",

        "list_metadef_resource_types":"",
        "get_metadef_resource_type":"",
        "add_metadef_resource_type_association":"",

        "get_metadef_property":"",
        "get_metadef_properties":"",
        "modify_metadef_property":"",
        "add_metadef_property":"",

        "get_metadef_tag":"",
        "get_metadef_tags":"",
        "modify_metadef_tag":"",
        "add_metadef_tag":"",
        "add_metadef_tags":""
     }

   For each parameter, use ``"rule:restricted"`` to restrict access to all
   users or ``"role:admin"`` to limit access to administrator roles.
   For example::

     "download_image":
     "upload_image":

#. Define which roles or policies can manage which properties in a property
   protections configuration file. For example::

     [x_none_read]
     create = context_is_admin
     read = !
     update = !
     delete = !

     [x_none_update]
     create = context_is_admin
     read = context_is_admin
     update = !
     delete = context_is_admin

     [x_none_delete]
     create = context_is_admin
     read = context_is_admin
     update = context_is_admin
     delete = !

   -  A value of ``@`` allows the corresponding operation for a property.

   -  A value of ``!`` disallows the corresponding operation for a
      property.

#. In the :file:`glance-api.conf` file, define the location of a property
   protections configuration file::

     property_protection_file = {file_name}

   This file contains the rules for property protections and the roles and
   policies associated with it.

   By default, property protections are not enforced.

   If you specify a file name value and the file is not found, the
   `glance-api` service does not start.

   To view a sample configuration file, see
   `glance-api.conf <http://docs.openstack.org/kilo/config-reference/content/section_glance-api.conf.html>`__.

#. Optionally, in the :file:`glance-api.conf` file, specify whether roles or
   policies are used in the property protections configuration file::

     property_protection_rule_format = roles

   The default is ``roles``.

   To view a sample configuration file, see
   `glance-api.conf <http://docs.openstack.org/kilo/config-reference/content/section_glance-api.conf.html>`__.

Image download: how it works
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Prior to starting a virtual machine, the virtual machine image used must
be transferred to the compute node from the Image service. How this
works can change depending on the settings chosen for the compute node
and the Image service.

Typically, the Compute service will use the image identifier passed to
it by the scheduler service and request the image from the Image API.
Though images are not stored in glance—rather in a back end, which could
be Object Storage, a filesystem or any other supported method—the
connection is made from the compute node to the Image service and the
image is transferred over this connection. The Image service streams the
image from the back end to the compute node.

It is possible to set up the Object Storage node on a separate network,
and still allow image traffic to flow between the Compute and Object
Storage nodes. Configure the ``my_block_storage_ip`` option in the
storage node configuration to allow block storage traffic to reach the
Compute node.

Certain back ends support a more direct method, where on request the
Image service will return a URL that can be used to download the image
directly from the back-end store. Currently the only store to support
the direct download approach is the filesystem store. It can be
configured using the ``filesystems`` option in the ``image_file_url``
section of the :file:`nova.conf` file on compute nodes.

Compute nodes also implement caching of images, meaning that if an image
has been used before it won't necessarily be downloaded every time.
Information on the configuration options for caching on compute nodes
can be found in the `Configuration
Reference <http://docs.openstack.org/kilo/config-reference/content/>`__.

Instance building blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In OpenStack, the base operating system is usually copied from an image
stored in the OpenStack Image service. This results in an ephemeral
instance that starts from a known template state and loses all
accumulated states on shutdown.

You can also put an operating system on a persistent volume in Compute
or the Block Storage volume system. This gives a more traditional,
persistent system that accumulates states that are preserved across
restarts. To get a list of available images on your system, run:

.. code:: console

    $ nova image-list
    +---------------------------+------------------+--------+----------------+
    | ID                        | Name             | Status | Server         |
    +---------------------------+------------------+--------+----------------+
    | aee1d242-730f-431f-88c1-  |                  |        |                |
    | 87630c0f07ba              | Ubuntu 14.04     |        |                |

    | 0b27baa1-0ca6-49a7-b3f4-  |                  |        |                |
    | 48388e440245              | Ubuntu 14.10     |        |                |
    |                           | cloudimg amd64   | ACTIVE |                |
    | df8d56fc-9cea-4dfd-a8d3-  |                  |        |                |
    | 28764de3cb08              | jenkins          | ACTIVE |                |
    +---------------------------+------------------+--------+----------------+

The displayed image attributes are:

``ID``
    Automatically generated UUID of the image.

``Name``
    Free form, human-readable name for the image.

``Status``
    The status of the image. Images marked ``ACTIVE`` are available for
    use.

``Server``
    For images that are created as snapshots of running instances, this
    is the UUID of the instance the snapshot derives from. For uploaded
    images, this field is blank.

Virtual hardware templates are called ``flavors``. The default
installation provides five predefined flavors.

For a list of flavors that are available on your system, run:

.. code:: console

    $ nova flavor-list
    +----+----------+----------+-----+----------+-----+------+------------+----------+
    | ID | Name     | Memory_MB| Disk| Ephemeral| Swap| VCPUs| RXTX_Factor| Is_Public|
    +----+----------+----------+-----+----------+-----+------+------------+----------+
    | 1  | m1.tiny  | 512      | 1   | 0        |     | 1    | 1.0        | True     |
    | 2  | m1.small | 2048     | 20  | 0        |     | 1    | 1.0        | True     |
    | 3  | m1.medium| 4096     | 40  | 0        |     | 2    | 1.0        | True     |
    | 4  | m1.large | 8192     | 80  | 0        |     | 4    | 1.0        | True     |
    | 5  | m1.xlarge| 16384    | 160 | 0        |     | 8    | 1.0        | True     |
    +----+----------+----------+-----+----------+-----+------+------------+----------+

By default, administrative users can configure the flavors. You can
change this behavior by redefining the access controls for
``compute_extension:flavormanage`` in :file:`/etc/nova/policy.json` on the
``compute-api`` server.


Instance management tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OpenStack provides command-line, web interface, and API-based instance
management tools. Third-party management tools are also available, using
either the native API or the provided EC2-compatible API.

The OpenStack python-novaclient package provides a basic command-line
utility, which uses the :command:`nova` command. This is available as a native
package for most Linux distributions, or you can install the latest
version using the pip python package installer:

::

    # pip install python-novaclient

For more information about python-novaclient and other command-line
tools, see the `OpenStack End User
Guide <http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/index.html>`__.


Control where instances run
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The `OpenStack Configuration
Reference <http://docs.openstack.org/kilo/config-reference/content/>`__
provides detailed information on controlling where your instances run,
including ensuring a set of instances run on different compute nodes for
service resiliency or on the same node for high performance
inter-instance communications.

Administrative users can specify which compute node their instances
run on. To do this, specify the ``--availability-zone
AVAILABILITY_ZONE:COMPUTE_HOST`` parameter.
