Start the Identity services
===========================

To start the services for Identity, run the following command:

.. code::

    $ keystone-all

This command starts two wsgi.Server instances configured by the
:file:`keystone.conf` file as described previously. One of these wsgi
servers is :code:`admin` (the administration API) and the other is
:code:`main` (the primary/public API interface). Both run in a single
process.
