Introduction
============

To administer Manila, it is helpful to understand a number of concepts like
share networks, shares, multi-tenancy and back ends that can be configured with
Manila. When configuring the File Share service, it is required to declare at
least one back end. Manila can be configured to run in a single-node
configuration or across multiple nodes. Manila can be configured to provision
shares from one or more back ends. The OpenStack File Share service allows you
to offer file-share services to users of an OpenStack installation.

Manila consists of three main services, which are similar to those of the
OpenStack Cinder project:

- manila-api
- manila-scheduler
- manila-share

Installation of first two - `manila-api` and `manila-scheduler` is common
for almost all deployments. But configuration of `manila-share` is
backend-specific and can differ from deployment to deployment.

Note that the `manila-share` service can run in two modes, with and without
handling of `share servers`.  In most cases share servers are virtual machines
that export file shares via various network file systems. The example in this
document describes a backend that manages share servers using network resources
provided by Neutron.

.. note::
    Manila supports any network architecture. When a driver is managing its own
    share servers, it can use any of several network plug-ins that provide
    network resources. Manila includes plug-ins for Neutron and Nova-network,
    as well as a `StandaloneNetworkPlugin` for simple networks. When a driver
    is not managing share servers, it has no need for network plug-ins.
