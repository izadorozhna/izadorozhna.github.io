The OpenStack Security Guide is the result of a five day sprint of
collaborative work of many individuals. The purpose of this document is
to provide the best practice guidelines for deploying a secure OpenStack
cloud. It is a living document that is updated as new changes are merged
into the repository, and is meant to reflect the current state of
security within the OpenStack community and provide frameworks for
decision making where listing specific security controls are not
feasible due to complexity or other environment specific details.
