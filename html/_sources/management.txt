A cloud deployment is a living system. Machines age and fail, software
becomes outdated, vulnerabilities are discovered. When errors or
omissions are made in configuration, or when software fixes must be
applied, these changes must be made in a secure, but convenient,
fashion. These changes are typically solved through configuration
management.

Likewise, it is important to protect the cloud deployment from being
configured or manipulated by malicious entities. With many systems in a
cloud employing compute and networking virtualization, there are
distinct challenges applicable to OpenStack which must be addressed
through integrity lifecycle management.

Finally, administrators must perform command and control over the cloud
for various operational functions. It is important these command and
control facilities are understood and secured.
