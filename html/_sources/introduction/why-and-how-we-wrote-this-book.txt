Why and how we wrote this book
==============================

As OpenStack adoption continues to grow and the product matures, security has
become a priority. The OpenStack Security Group has recognized the need for a
comprehensive and authoritative security guide. The **OpenStack Security
Guide** has been written to provide an overview of security best practices,
guidelines, and recommendations for increasing the security of an OpenStack
deployment. The authors bring their expertise from deploying and securing
OpenStack in a variety of environments.

This guide augments the `OpenStack Operations Guide
<http://docs.openstack.org/ops/>`__ and can be referenced to harden existing
OpenStack deployments or to evaluate the security controls of OpenStack cloud
providers.

Objectives
~~~~~~~~~~

-  Identify the security domains in OpenStack
-  Provide guidance to secure your OpenStack deployment
-  Highlight security concerns and potential mitigations in present day
   OpenStack
-  Discuss upcoming security features
-  To provide a community driven facility for knowledge capture and
   dissemination

How
~~~

As with the OpenStack Operations Guide, we followed the book sprint
methodology. The book sprint process allows for rapid development and
production of large bodies of written work. Coordinators from the OpenStack
Security Group re-enlisted the services of Adam Hyde as facilitator. Corporate
support was obtained and the project was formally announced during the
OpenStack summit in Portland, Oregon.

The team converged in Annapolis, MD due to the close proximity of some key
members of the group. This was a remarkable collaboration between public sector
intelligence community members, silicon valley startups and some large,
well-known technology companies. The book sprint ran during the last week in
June 2013 and the first edition was created in five days.
