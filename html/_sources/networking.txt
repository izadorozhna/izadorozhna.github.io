Networking
==========

OpenStack Networking enables the end-user or tenant to define, utilize, and
consume networking resources. OpenStack Networking provides a tenant-facing API
for defining network connectivity and IP addressing for instances in the cloud
in addition to orchestrating the network configuration. With the transition to
an API-centric networking service, cloud architects and administrators should
take into consideration best practices to secure physical and virtual network
infrastructure and services.

OpenStack Networking was designed with a plug-in architecture that provides
extensibility of the API through open source community or third-party services.
As you evaluate your architectural design requirements, it is important to
determine what features are available in OpenStack Networking core services,
any additional services that are provided by third-party products, and what
supplemental services are required to be implemented in the physical
infrastructure.

This section is a high-level overview of what processes and best practices
should be considered when implementing OpenStack Networking. We will talk about
the current state of services that are available, what future services will be
implemented, and the current limitations in this project.
