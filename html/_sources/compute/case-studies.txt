Case studies
============

Earlier in :doc:`../introduction/introduction-to-case-studies` we
introduced the Alice and Bob case studies where Alice is deploying a
private government cloud and Bob is deploying a public cloud each with
different security requirements. Here we discuss how Alice and Bob
would ensure that their instances are properly isolated. First we consider
hypervisor selection, and then techniques for hardening QEMU and applying
mandatory access controls.


Alice's private cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alice chooses Xen for the hypervisor in her cloud due to a strong internal
knowledge base and a desire to use the Xen security modules (XSM) for
fine-grained policy enforcement.

Alice is willing to apply a relatively large amount of resources to software
packaging and maintenance. She will use these resources to build a highly
customized version of QEMU that has many components removed, thereby reducing
the attack surface. She will also ensure that all compiler hardening options
are enabled for QEMU. Alice accepts that these decisions will increase
long-term maintenance costs.

Alice writes XSM policies (for Xen) and SELinux policies (for Linux domain 0,
and device domains) to provide stronger isolation between the instances. Alice
also uses the Intel TXT support in Xen to measure the hypervisor launch in the
TPM.

She then ensures there are restrictive file permissions, such as 640, on all
sensitive files, such as :file:`nova.conf`, and directories. After outlining
a process for creating and updating 'golden images' that will be the templates
for images, she also tests and then configures the ``AvailabilityZoneFilter``
to enable regional zones, and the ``ServerGroupAffinityFilter`` with the
``AggregateIoOps`` filters to distribute load across systems.


Bob's public cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bob is very concerned about instance isolation since the users in a public
cloud represent anyone with a credit card, meaning they are inherently
untrusted. Bob has just started hiring the team that will deploy the cloud, so
he can tailor his candidate search for specific areas of expertise. With this
in mind, Bob chooses a hypervisor based on its technical features,
certifications, and community support. KVM has an EAL 4+ common criteria
rating, with a labeled security protection profile (LSPP) to provide added
assurance for instance isolation. This, combined with the strong support for
KVM within the OpenStack community drives Bob's decision to use KVM.

Bob weighs the added cost of repackaging QEMU and decides that he cannot commit
those resources to the project. Fortunately, his Linux distribution has already
enabled the compiler hardening options. So he decides to use this QEMU package.
Finally, Bob leverages sVirt to manage the SELinux polices associated with the
virtualization stack.
