System documentation
====================

The system documentation for an OpenStack cloud deployment should follow the
templates and best practices for the Enterprise Information Technology System

architecture of a given system. There are common challenges across the industry
related to documenting the dynamic cloud infrastructure and keeping the
information up-to-date.
