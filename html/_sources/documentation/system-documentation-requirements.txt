System documentation requirements
=================================

System roles and types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The two broadly defined types of nodes that generally make up an OpenStack
installation are:

Infrastructure nodes
   The nodes that run the cloud related services such as the OpenStack
   Identity service, the message queuing service, storage, networking, and
   other services required to support the operation of the cloud.

Compute, storage, or other resource nodes
   Provide storage capacity or virtual machines for your cloud.

System inventory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Documentation should provide a general description of the OpenStack environment
and cover all systems used (production, development, test, etc.). Documenting
system components, networks, services, and software often provides the
bird's-eye view needed to thoroughly cover and consider security concerns,
attack vectors and possible security domain bridging points. A system inventory
may need to capture ephemeral resources such as virtual machines or virtual
disk volumes that would otherwise be persistent resources in a traditional IT
system.

Hardware inventory
------------------

Clouds without stringent compliance requirements for written documentation
might benefit from having a Configuration Management Database
(:term:`configuration management database (CMDB)<CMDB>`). CMDBs are
normally used for hardware asset tracking and overall life-cycle
management. By leveraging a CMDB, an organization can quickly identify
cloud infrastructure hardware such as compute nodes, storage nodes, or
network devices. A CMDB can assist in identifying assets that exist on
the network which may have vulnerabilities due to inadequate
maintenance, inadequate protection or being displaced and forgotten. An
OpenStack provisioning system can provide some basic CMDB functions if
the underlying hardware supports the necessary auto-discovery features.

Software inventory
------------------

As with hardware, all software components within the OpenStack deployment
should be documented. Examples include:

* System databases, such as MySQL or mongoDB
* OpenStack software components, such as Identity or Compute
* Supporting components, such as load-balancers, reverse proxies, DNS or DHCP
  services

An authoritative list of software components may be critical when assessing the
impact of a compromise or vulnerability in a library, application or class of
software.

Network topology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A network topology should be provided with highlights specifically calling out
the data flows and bridging points between the security domains. Network
ingress and egress points should be identified along with any OpenStack logical
system boundaries. Multiple diagrams may be needed to provide complete visual
coverage of the system. A network topology document should include virtual
networks created on behalf of tenants by the system along with virtual machine
instances and gateways created by OpenStack.

Services, protocols and ports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Knowing information about organizational assets is typically a best practice,
therefore it is beneficial to create a table which contains information
regarding the service, protocols and ports being utilized in the OpenStack
deployment. The table can be created from information derived from a CMDB or
can be constructed manually. The table can be customized to include an overview
of all services running within the cloud infrastructure. The level of detail
contained in this type of table can be beneficial as the information can
immediately inform, guide, and assist with validating security requirements.
Standard security components such as firewall configuration, service port
conflicts, security remediation areas, and compliance become easier to maintain
when concise information is available. An example of this type of table is
provided below:

Referencing a table of services, protocols and ports can help in understanding
the relationship between OpenStack components. It is highly recommended that
OpenStack deployments have information similar to this on record.
