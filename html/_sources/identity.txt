Identity
========

Identity service (keystone) provides identity, token, catalog, and
policy services for use specifically by services in the OpenStack
family. Identity service is organized as a group of internal services
exposed on one or many endpoints. Many of these services are used in a
combined fashion by the frontend, for example an authenticate call will
validate user/project credentials with the identity service and, upon
success, create and return a token with the token service. Further
information can be found by reading the `Keystone Developer
Documentation <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/keystone/index.html>`__.
