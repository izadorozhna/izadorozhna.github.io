Shared File Systems
===================

The Shared File Systems Storage service provides a set of services for
management of shared file systems in a multi-tenant cloud environment, similar
to how OpenStack provides for block-based storage management through the
OpenStack Block Storage service project. With the Shared File Systems service,
you can create a remote file system, mount the file system on your instances,
and then read and write data from your instances to and from your file system.

A large amount of existing software is designed around file-based storage. The
Shared File Systems service provides the management of file shares for example,
NFS and CIFS as a core service to OpenStack and currently works with NetApp,
Red Hat storage (GlusterFS) and EMC VNX, as well as on a base Linux NFS or
Samba server.

The Shared File Systems Storage serves the same purpose as the Amazon
Elastic File System (EFS) offering does.
